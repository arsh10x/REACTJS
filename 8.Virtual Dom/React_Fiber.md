## React Fiber
React Fiber is a complete rewrite of React's core algorithm introduced in React 16. It's the new reconciliation engine.

### Key Features:
- **Incremental rendering:** Ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
- **Ability to pause, abort, or reuse work** as new updates come in.
- **Ability to assign priority** to different types of updates.
- New concurrency primitives.

### How it Works:
- Fiber introduces the concept of a "fiber" as a unit of work.
- It creates a virtual stack frame for each component, allowing React to pause rendering and come back to it later.

This enables React to:
- Interrupt rendering to handle high-priority updates.
- Reuse previously completed work.
- Abort work if it's no longer needed.

### Benefits:
- **Improved performance** for complex applications.
- **Better user experience** by prioritizing critical updates.
- **Smoother animations and interactions.**
