# SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

---

## What are SSR and CSR?

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
"SSR is a technique where the server processes and renders the web page, sending the fully formed HTML to the client. When a user requests a page, the server generates the HTML content, including the data fetched from databases or APIs, and sends it to the browser."

### CSR (Client-Side Rendering):
"CSR, on the other hand, relies on JavaScript running in the user's browser to render the page. The server sends a minimal HTML file and JavaScript bundle. The JavaScript then fetches data and dynamically generates the content on the client-side."

## Key Differences:

- **Initial Load**:
  - SSR typically has a faster initial page load because the server sends pre-rendered HTML.
  - CSR might have a slower initial load due to downloading JavaScript before rendering.

- **Subsequent Navigation**:
  - CSR often provides faster subsequent page navigation as it only needs to fetch data, not entire HTML pages.

- **Server Load**:
  - SSR puts more load on the server as it handles rendering, while CSR offloads this task to the client's browser.

- **Complexity**:
  - CSR can be more complex to set up and manage, especially for large applications, while SSR can be simpler in some cases.

## SEO and Performance:

- **SEO**:
  - SSR generally performs better for SEO because search engine crawlers can easily read the fully rendered HTML content.
  - CSR can pose challenges for SEO if not implemented correctly, as some crawlers might not execute JavaScript efficiently.

- **Performance**:
  - SSR typically offers faster initial page loads and better performance on lower-end devices.
  - CSR can provide a more app-like experience with smoother transitions between pages once the initial load is complete.
  - SSR can be beneficial in regions with slower internet connections as it sends ready-to-display content.
